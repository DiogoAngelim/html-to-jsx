# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by opening an issue with the label `security` or by contacting the maintainers directly. We will respond as quickly as possible to address the issue.

Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and fixed.
